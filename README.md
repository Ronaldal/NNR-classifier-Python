# NNR-classifier-Python
## Introduction
A nearest neighbors in radius (NNR) classifier is a variation of the KNN classifier,
where instead of looking for the majority vote within K nearest neighbors of an instance, it inspects all
instanceâ€™s neighbors in a given radius and assigns it a label according the majority vote in the radius.
